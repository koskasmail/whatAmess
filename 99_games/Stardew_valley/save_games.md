#### Duplicate a Save on Android

You can definitely duplicate a save file in *Stardew Valley* on Androidâ€”it just takes a few steps using a file manager app. Here's how to do it:

### ðŸ“± How to Duplicate a Save on Android

#### 1. **Get a File Manager App**
Use any trusted file manager from the Play Store (like *Files by Google* or *X-Plore File Manager*).

#### 2. **Locate Your Save Files**
Your save files are stored in:
```
Android/data/com.chucklefish.stardewvalley/files/saves
```
Each save is a folder named like `FarmerName_123456789`.

#### 3. **Copy and Rename the Folder**
- Long-press the folder of the save you want to duplicate.
- Select **Copy** and paste it back into the same `saves` directory.
- Rename the copied folder to something unique (e.g., `LeahFarm_987654321`).

#### 4. **Rename the Files Inside**
Inside the folder, youâ€™ll see two files:
- `FarmerName_123456789`
- `SaveGameInfo`

Rename both files to match the new folder name:
- `LeahFarm_987654321`
- `SaveGameInfo` (this one usually stays the same)

#### 5. **Launch the Game**
Open *Stardew Valley* and go to the Load Game screenâ€”you should see your duplicated save ready to play!

ðŸ›‘ **Important Tip**: Donâ€™t uninstall the game without backing up your saves. Android deletes all files in that folder when the app is removed.
