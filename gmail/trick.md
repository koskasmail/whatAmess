If you want to clean up Gmail *smartly*—not just deleting one message at a time—there are several powerful built‑in tools that most people never use. Here’s how to make Gmail do the heavy lifting for you.

---

## 🧹 **1. Use Gmail’s Search Operators (Super Powerful)**
These let you instantly find and delete large groups of emails.

### **Useful examples**
- **Older than 1 year:**  
  `older_than:1y`
- **Larger than 5MB:**  
  `larger:5m`
- **From a specific sender:**  
  `from:news@company.com`
- **All promotions:**  
  `category:promotions`
- **Unread mail:**  
  `is:unread`

Once the results appear → **Select all → Delete**.

## 🧠 **2. Auto‑Delete Using Filters (Smart Automation)**
This is the real “smart” method because Gmail will clean itself automatically.

### **How to set it up**
1. Open Gmail.  
2. Click the **gear icon → See all settings**.  
3. Go to **Filters and Blocked Addresses**.  
4. Click **Create a new filter**.  
5. Enter conditions (e.g., sender, subject, keywords).  
6. Click **Create filter**.  
7. Check **Delete it** (or **Skip Inbox + Apply label** if you want to review first).

Now Gmail will delete those emails automatically as they arrive.

## 🧭 **3. Use “Unsubscribe” + Block**
If you keep deleting the same newsletters:

- Open the email → click **Unsubscribe** (Gmail shows this near the sender).
- Or click the **three dots → Block sender**.

This prevents future clutter.

## 📦 **4. Bulk Delete by Category**
Gmail automatically sorts some mail:

- **Promotions**  
- **Social**  
- **Updates**  
- **Forums**

Go to each tab → **Select all → Delete**.

---

## 🗂️ **5. Use Storage Cleanup (for big attachments)**
Go to:  
**Google Account → Manage Storage → Gmail**

It shows large emails you can delete in bulk.
