You can absolutely download all your old Gmail **Sent Mail from 2024 and earlier** to your computer — Google provides an official way to do it, and there are a couple of alternative methods depending on how you prefer to store email.

Below is a clear, practical breakdown so you can choose the approach that fits your workflow.

## 📦 Option 1: Use **Google Takeout** (Best for downloading everything at once)

Google Takeout lets you export **all Gmail messages**, including Sent Mail, filtered by label if you want.

### 🔧 Steps
- Go to **Google Takeout** (Google’s official export tool).  
- Select **Mail** only.  
- (Optional) Click the arrow next to Mail → choose **Sent Mail** label if you want *only* sent messages.  
- Export and download the archive (.zip).  
- Inside the archive, your mail will be in **MBOX** format, which can be opened by many email clients.

## 💻 Option 2: Use an Email Client (Outlook, Thunderbird) via IMAP

If you want your Sent Mail stored locally in a traditional email program:

### 🔧 Steps
- Enable **IMAP** in Gmail settings.  
- Add your Gmail account to Outlook, Thunderbird, Apple Mail, etc.  
- Let it sync.  
- Copy or move **Sent Mail** to a **local folder** inside the client (this stores it on your computer permanently).

## 🧰 Option 3: Use Backup Utilities (IMAPSize, Gmail Backup)

Tools like **IMAPSize** or **Gmail Backup & Restore Utility** can download selected folders (like Sent Mail) directly to your PC.

### When this is useful:
- You want only specific years (e.g., 2024 and older).  
- You want incremental backups.  
- You prefer not to sync a full email client.

## 📝 Notes About Filtering by Year (2024 and older)

Google Takeout **does not filter by date**, only by label.  
To get only 2024 and older:

### Workarounds:
- **Create a Gmail label** (e.g., “Sent ≤2024”).  
- Use Gmail search:  
  ```
  in:sent before:2025
  ```
- Select all results → apply your new label.  
- In Google Takeout, export **only that label**.

## 🧭 Want the simplest method?

If you just want everything in Sent Mail up to 2024 in one file, the **Takeout + label filter** method is the cleanest.

If you want ongoing local storage, use **Thunderbird** or **Outlook**.
