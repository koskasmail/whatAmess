**Creating a Custom Viewer for IBM Content Navigator Using Plugins**

**1. Understand the Plugin Framework**

* **Purpose:** Plugins extend Content Navigator's functionality, allowing you to customize how content is displayed, interacted with, and managed.
* **Key Components:**
    * **Viewer:** The core component responsible for rendering content.
    * **Viewer Map:** Defines which viewer should be used for specific file types or MIME types.
    * **JavaScript APIs:** Content Navigator provides JavaScript APIs for interacting with the platform and customizing the user interface.

**2. Design Your Viewer**

* **Functionality:** Determine the specific features and behavior you want your viewer to have:
    * **Content Rendering:** How will it display different file types (e.g., images, documents, videos)?
    * **User Interaction:** Will it allow for annotations, zooming, printing, or other actions?
    * **Integration:** How will it integrate with other Content Navigator features (e.g., search, metadata)?
* **Technology Stack:** Choose the technologies you'll use to build your viewer:
    * **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Essential for building the user interface.
    * **Frameworks:** Consider using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for component-based development.
    * **Libraries:** Utilize libraries for specific functionalities like image/video handling, data visualization, etc.

**3. Develop the Viewer**

* **Create the Viewer Component:** Build the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your viewer.
* **Implement Viewer Logic:** Handle content loading, rendering, and user interactions.
* **Integrate with Content Navigator APIs:** Use the JavaScript APIs to:
    * **Fetch content data:** Retrieve document properties, content streams, etc.
    * **Interact with the user interface:** Customize menus, toolbars, and other UI elements.
    * **Trigger actions:** Perform actions like checking in/out documents, starting workflows, etc.

**4. Create the Viewer Map**

* **Define Mappings:** Create a viewer map that associates your custom viewer with specific file types or MIME types.
* **Configure Order:** Specify the order of viewers in the map to control which viewer is used by default.

**5. Deploy and Test**

* **Package the Plugin:** Package your viewer and its dependencies into a JAR file or deploy it as a web application.
* **Deploy to Content Navigator:** Install the plugin on your Content Navigator server.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Test the viewer with various file types and ensure it functions as expected.

**Example: A Simple Image Viewer**

1. **Viewer Component (HTML):**

```html
<div id="image-viewer">
    <img id="image-preview" src="" alt="Image Preview">
</div>
```

2. **Viewer Logic (JavaScript):**

```javascript
function loadImage(contentStream) {
    // Convert contentStream to a data URL
    const imageUrl = 'data:' + contentStream.mimeType + ';base64,' + btoa(contentStream.content);
    document.getElementById('image-preview').src = imageUrl;
}
```

3. **Viewer Map:**

* Create a new viewer map.
* Add a mapping for image file types (e.g., 'image/jpeg', 'image/png') to your custom image viewer.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Performance Optimization:** Optimize your viewer for performance, especially when handling large files.
* **Accessibility:** Ensure your viewer is accessible to users with disabilities.
* **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data.
* **Documentation:** Create clear documentation for your plugin to help others understand and use it.

By following these steps, you can create custom viewers that enhance the user experience and tailor Content Navigator to your specific needs.

**Remember:** This is a general overview. The specific implementation details will vary depending on the complexity of your viewer and your organization's requirements. Refer to the official IBM Content Navigator documentation for detailed instructions and best practices.
