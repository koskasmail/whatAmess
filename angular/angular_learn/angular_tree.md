## Angular

To build a GitHub repository for learning **Angular**, it's best to follow a modular, scalable folder structure inspired by Angular's official style guide and community best practices. Here's a recommended layout based on insights from [Angular Courses](https://www.angular.courses/blog/angular-folder-structure-guide/) and GitHub examples like [mdali602/angular-folder-structure](https://github.com/mdali602/angular-folder-structure):

## 📘 Tips for Using the Repository

- **README.md**: Include setup instructions, learning goals, and how to navigate the repo.
- **Modular structure**: Use `core`, `shared`, and `features` folders to follow Angular's scalable architecture.
- **Projects folder**: Apply your skills in real-world apps like task managers or e-commerce sites.
- **Tests folder**: Practice unit and end-to-end testing with Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor.
- **Resources folder**: Store cheat sheets, links to documentation, and tutorials.
