## 📘 README.md — Angular Overview

### 🧠 What is Angular?

```js
Angular is a powerful, open-source web application framework developed by Google.
It enables developers to build dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
Angular follows a component-based architecture and provides tools for routing, form handling,
HTTP communication, and more — all out of the box.
