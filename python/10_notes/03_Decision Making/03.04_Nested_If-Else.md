#### temperature check

```
temperature = 15;
weather = "unset";

if temperature <= 25:
    if temperature < 0:
        weather = "Freezing";
    elif temperature >= 0 and temperature <= 15:
        weather = "Cold";
    elif temperature >= 16 and temperature <= 25:
        weather = "Mild";
elif temperature >= 26:
    weather = "Hot";
else:
    weather = "other";
  
print(f"weather is:  {weather}");
```

###### output: 

```
weather is:  Cold
```

#### `age` check

```
age = 81;

if age < 18:
    if age <= 2:
        ##---[if block Start]---##
        print(f"age {age} --> Baby");

    elif age > 2 and age < 12:
        print(f"age {age} --> Child");
    else:
        ##---[else block Start]---##
        print(f"age {age} --> Teenager");
elif age >= 18 and age <= 80:
    print(f"age {age} --> Adult");
else:
    print(f"age {age} --> Super-Adult ");
```

###### output
```
age 81 --> Super-Adult
```

#### wind speed

```
wind = 29;
status = "unset";

if wind <= 63:
    if wind < 8:
        status = "Calm";
    elif wind >= 8 and wind <= 31:
        status = "Breeze";
    elif wind >= 32 and wind <= 63:
        status = "Gale";
else:
    status = "Storm";

print(f"status = {status}");
```

###### output
```
status = Breeze
```

#### Age restricted movies

* Write your nested if-else code here
    * `age >= 18` ==> print  "You can watch any movie"
    * `age < 18 and with_parent = true`  ==> print "You can watch PG-13 movies"
    * `age < 18 and with_parent = false`  ==> "You can only watch G-rated movies"


#### code

```
# Get age as an integer
# age = int(input())

# Get parental guidance as a boolean (True/False)
# with_parent = input() == "True"

age = 23;
with_parent = False;

if age < 18:
   if with_parent == True:
       print("You can watch PG-13 movies");
   else:
       print("You can only watch G-rated movies");   
else:
    print("You can watch any movie");  
```

###### output

```
You can watch any movie
```

#### game level checked

* Level 1-5: Can only use Basic weapons
* Level 6-10: Can use Advanced weapons if they completed training
* Level 11+: Can use any weapon

* Print messages based on the conditions:
    * If level 1-5: Basic weapons only
    * If level 6-10 and no training: Need weapon training first
    * If level 6-10 and has training: Access to advanced weapons granted
    * If level 11+: Access to all weapons granted
    * If level is 0 or negative: Invalid level

#### code

```
# Write your code below
if level > 0:
    if level >= 1 and level <= 5:
        print("Basic weapons only");
    elif level >= 6 and level <= 10:
        if has_training == False:
            print("Need weapon training first");
        else:
            print("Access to advanced weapons granted");
    
    elif level >= 11:
        print("Access to all weapons granted");
else:
    print("Invalid level");
```


###### output
