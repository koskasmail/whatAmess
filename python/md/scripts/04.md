Here are the **simplest and most common Ubuntu commands to show your disk size**, based on the information from the search results.

---

## 🟦 **Quickest way: human‑readable disk size**
```bash
df -H
```
This shows total size, used space, free space, and mount points in an easy‑to‑read format.

---

## 🟩 **Show all disks and their sizes (very clear)**
```bash
lsblk
```
This lists every block device (disks + partitions) with their sizes.

---

## 🟧 **Show detailed disk info**
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```
Displays disk size, partitions, and filesystem details.

---

## 🟨 **Graphical tools (if you prefer GUI)**
Ubuntu also includes:
- **Disk Usage Analyzer**
- **Disks utility**

These show disk size and usage visually.
