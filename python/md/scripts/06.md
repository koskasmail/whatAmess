If your goal is simply to **run Ubuntu (Linux) shell commands from Python**, you can do that very easily using the built‑in `os` or `subprocess` modules. No extra installs needed.

Here are the cleanest and safest ways to do it.

---

# 🟦 **Method 1: `os.system()` — simplest**

```python
import os

os.system("ls -l")
```

This runs the command exactly as if you typed it in the Ubuntu terminal.

---

# 🟩 **Method 2: `subprocess.run()` — recommended**

```python
import subprocess

subprocess.run(["ls", "-l"])
```

This avoids shell parsing issues and is more secure.

---

# 🟧 **Method 3: Capture the output**

```python
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(["df", "-h"], capture_output=True, text=True)
print(result.stdout)
```

This lets you use the command output inside Python.

---

# 🟨 **Run any Ubuntu command**

Examples:

### Show disk size
```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["df", "-h"])
```

### Show CPU info
```python
subprocess.run(["lscpu"])
```

### Show memory
```python
subprocess.run(["free", "-h"])
```

### Update packages
```python
subprocess.run(["sudo", "apt", "update"])
```

If you want, tell me what command you want to run from Python, and I can write the exact snippet for it.
