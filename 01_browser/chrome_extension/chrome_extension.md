```
VisBug is an open-source browser extension designed for web designers and developers.
It allows users to visually inspect, edit, and tweak web pages directly in the browser,
much like a design tool. With VisBug, you can:
Modify text and images on any webpage.
Adjust spacing, alignment, and styles.
Inspect accessibility features.
Resize and reposition elements interactively.

It's a great tool for designers who want to experiment with layouts without diving into code.
