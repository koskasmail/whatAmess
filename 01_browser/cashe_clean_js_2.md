Here are a few additional methods to handle cache management in your web application:

### 5. HTTP Headers
You can set HTTP headers to control caching behavior on the server side. Common headers include:

- **Cache-Control**: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses.
  
  ```plaintext
  Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
  ```

- **Expires**: Specifies an expiration date for the cached content.

  ```plaintext
  Expires: Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT
  ```

- **ETag**: A unique identifier for a specific version of a resource. The browser can use this to check if the resource has changed.

### 6. Versioning Assets
Implement a versioning system for your assets. This involves changing the filenames when you update your files:

```html
<script src="script.v2.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.v2.css">
```

### 7. Using Service Workers for Cache Control
You can configure a Service Worker to cache specific assets while ignoring others. Here's a simple implementation:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    event.respondWith(
        caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
            // Return cached response or fetch from network
            return response || fetch(event.request);
        })
    );
});
```

### 8. Clearing Specific Cache Entries
If you want to clear specific cached items in a Service Worker:

```javascript
caches.open('my-cache').then((cache) => {
    cache.delete('/path/to/resource');
});
```

### 9. Use Local Storage
For dynamic data that changes frequently, consider using local storage. This way, you can manage what data to keep and clear it as needed:

```javascript
// Store data
localStorage.setItem('myData', JSON.stringify(data));

// Clear specific data
localStorage.removeItem('myData');

// Clear all local storage
localStorage.clear();
```

### Summary
By leveraging HTTP headers, versioning, service workers, and local storage, you can effectively manage cache behavior and ensure users receive the most up-to-date content.
