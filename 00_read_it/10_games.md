#### what is the different between the cube games okey to Rummikub

#### Both Okey and Rummikub are tile-based games that involve matching and strategy, but there are some key differences between them:

#### Okey:
1. **Tiles**: Okey uses a set of 106 tiles, which include numbers 1 to 13 in four different colors (similar to dominoes) and two joker tiles.
2. **Gameplay**: Players draw and discard tiles, aiming to create sets of matching tiles (either by number or runs of consecutive numbers in the same color).
3. **Players**: Typically played with 2 to 4 players.
4. **Jokers**: Jokers can substitute for any tile, but their value changes throughout the game.
5. **Objective**: The main goal is to form a complete set of tiles and declare "Okey" before your opponents.

#### Rummikub:
1. **Tiles**: Rummikub also uses 106 tiles but includes numbers 1 to 13 in four colors, plus two joker tiles. The tiles are numbered rather than having distinct colors for sets.
2. **Gameplay**: Similar to Okey, players draw and discard tiles to create sets and runs, but Rummikub allows for more complex movements and rearrangements of existing sets on the table.
3. **Players**: Usually played with 2 to 4 players, but can accommodate more.
4. **Jokers**: Jokers can also substitute for any tile, with similar strategic importance.
5. **Objective**: Players aim to be the first to play all their tiles, rather than simply forming a complete set to declare victory.

#### Summary:
- **Okey** is more straightforward and focused on forming a single set to win, while **Rummikub** emphasizes strategic play with existing sets and has more complexity in gameplay.
