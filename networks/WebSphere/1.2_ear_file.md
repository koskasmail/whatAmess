Deploying a **WAR file** in IBM WebSphere is straightforward, but your second requirement — *“deploy all dependencies of the EAR file”* — depends on how your application is structured. Let’s walk through both scenarios clearly so you can get everything running smoothly.

---

# ⭐ Part 1 — Deploy a WAR File in WebSphere

A WAR can be deployed **directly**, just like an EAR.

### **Steps (Admin Console)**  
1. Open the console:  
   ```
   https://<host>:9043/ibm/console
   ```
2. Go to:  
   **Applications → New Application → New Enterprise Application**
3. Click **Browse** and select your `.war` file  
4. Click **Next**  
5. Choose **Fast Path** or **Detailed**  
6. Assign it to a server or cluster  
7. Set the **context root** (e.g., `/myapp`)  
8. Finish → Save → Start the application

WebSphere automatically wraps the WAR into an internal EAR during deployment.

# ⭐ Part 2 — Deploying an EAR *with all its dependencies*

This depends on how your EAR is packaged.

## ✔ Scenario A — EAR already contains all modules  
If your EAR includes:
- WAR modules  
- EJB modules  
- Shared libraries  
- Utility JARs  

…then WebSphere deploys **everything inside the EAR automatically**.  
You do **not** deploy WARs separately.

### EAR structure example:
```
MyApp.ear
 ├── app.war
 ├── ejb.jar
 ├── lib/
 │    ├── commons-lang.jar
 │    ├── custom-utils.jar
 └── META-INF/application.xml
```

WebSphere deploys all modules in one step.

---

## ✔ Scenario B — EAR depends on external shared libraries  
If your EAR references external JARs, you must configure:

### **Shared Libraries**
Admin Console →  
**Environment → Shared Libraries**

Then attach them to:
- The application  
- The server  
- The classloader  

### **Classloader order**
Often set to:
```
PARENT_LAST
```
to ensure your app’s libraries override WebSphere’s.

---

## ✔ Scenario C — EAR depends on other EAR/WAR applications  
If your EAR needs other applications deployed first (e.g., a service EAR), you must:

- Deploy the dependency EAR/WAR first  
- Ensure JNDI names match  
- Ensure security roles match  
- Ensure datasources exist  

WebSphere does **not** auto-deploy external dependencies.

---

# ⭐ Part 3 — Deploying via Command Line (wsadmin)

### Install WAR:
```sh
wsadmin.sh -c "AdminApp.install('/path/app.war', '[-contextroot /myapp -server server1]')"
```

### Install EAR:
```sh
wsadmin.sh -c "AdminApp.install('/path/app.ear', '[-server server1]')"
```

### Start application:
```sh
wsadmin.sh -c "AdminControl.invoke(AdminControl.queryNames('type=Application,name=MyApp,*'), 'start')"
```

---

# ⭐ Part 4 — If you want WebSphere to auto‑deploy dependencies  
WebSphere supports **monitored directories**:

Drop EAR/WAR files into:
```
<profile>/monitoredDeployableApps/
```

WebSphere automatically deploys them.

# If you want, I can guide you based on your exact setup  
Tell me:

- Are you deploying **only a WAR**, or a **full EAR**?  
- Does your EAR contain all modules, or does it rely on external JARs?  
- Are you using **WebSphere ND** (cluster) or **standalone**?  
- Do you need help with **classloaders**, **JNDI**, or **shared libraries**?

I can walk you through the exact steps for your environment.
