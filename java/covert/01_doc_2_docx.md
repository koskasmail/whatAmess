To convert a `.doc` file (older binary format) to `.docx` (modern XML-based format) using Java, the most reliable and widely used approach is to leverage the **Apache POI** library in combination with **LibreOffice** or **Aspose.Words for Java**, depending on your needs. Here's a breakdown of the best options:

---

### üõ† Option 1: Using LibreOffice with Java (via UNO or command line)
LibreOffice can handle `.doc` to `.docx` conversion very well.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
- High fidelity conversion
- Supports complex formatting and embedded objects

#### üöÄ How to use (Command Line Wrapper):
```java
String inputPath = "input.doc";
String outputPath = "output.docx";

// LibreOffice must be installed and added to PATH
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
    "soffice",
    "--headless",
    "--convert-to", "docx",
    "--outdir", new File(outputPath).getParent(),
    inputPath
);
pb.start();
```

### üì¶ Option 2: Aspose.Words for Java (Commercial Library)
Aspose is a powerful commercial library that supports seamless conversion between formats.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
- No need for external software
- Handles advanced formatting, images, tables, etc.

#### üöÄ Sample Code:
```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

Document doc = new Document("input.doc");
doc.save("output.docx");
```

> Note: Requires a license for full functionality.

### üìö Option 3: Apache POI (Limited Support for `.doc`)
Apache POI is great for `.docx`, but its support for `.doc` is limited via the HWPF module.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- Doesn‚Äôt support full fidelity conversion
- Not suitable for complex documents

#### üöÄ Sample Code (basic read/write):
```java
import org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument;
import org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.XWPFDocument;

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.doc");
HWPFDocument doc = new HWPFDocument(fis);

// You'd need to manually extract text and rebuild a docx
XWPFDocument docx = new XWPFDocument();
// Add paragraphs, tables, etc., manually

FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("output.docx");
docx.write(out);
```

---

### üß† Recommendation
If you're looking for **accuracy and ease**, go with **LibreOffice** or **Aspose.Words**. Apache POI is better suited for `.docx` manipulation, not conversion from `.doc`.
