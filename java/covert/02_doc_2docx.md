To convert a `.doc` file (older binary format) to `.docx` (modern XML-based format) using Java, the most reliable and widely used approach is to leverage the **Apache POI** library in combination with **LibreOffice** or **Aspose.Words for Java**, depending on your needs. Here's a breakdown of the best options:

---

### üõ† Option 1: Using LibreOffice with Java (via UNO or command line)
LibreOffice can handle `.doc` to `.docx` conversion very well.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
- High fidelity conversion
- Supports complex formatting and embedded objects

#### üöÄ How to use (Command Line Wrapper):
```java
String inputPath = "input.doc";
String outputPath = "output.docx";

// LibreOffice must be installed and added to PATH
ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
    "soffice",
    "--headless",
    "--convert-to", "docx",
    "--outdir", new File(outputPath).getParent(),
    inputPath
);
pb.start();
```

---

### üì¶ Option 2: Aspose.Words for Java (Commercial Library)
Aspose is a powerful commercial library that supports seamless conversion between formats.

#### ‚úÖ Pros:
- No need for external software
- Handles advanced formatting, images, tables, etc.

#### üöÄ Sample Code:
```java
import com.aspose.words.Document;

Document doc = new Document("input.doc");
doc.save("output.docx");
```

> Note: Requires a license for full functionality.

---

### üìö Option 3: Apache POI (Limited Support for `.doc`)
Apache POI is great for `.docx`, but its support for `.doc` is limited via the HWPF module.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- Doesn‚Äôt support full fidelity conversion
- Not suitable for complex documents

#### üöÄ Sample Code (basic read/write):
```java
import org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument;
import org.apache.poi.xwpf.usermodel.XWPFDocument;

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("input.doc");
HWPFDocument doc = new HWPFDocument(fis);

// You'd need to manually extract text and rebuild a docx
XWPFDocument docx = new XWPFDocument();
// Add paragraphs, tables, etc., manually

FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream("output.docx");
docx.write(out);
```

---

### üß† Recommendation
If you're looking for **accuracy and ease**, go with **LibreOffice** or **Aspose.Words**. Apache POI is better suited for `.docx` manipulation, not conversion from `.doc`.

Absolutely! LibreOffice is a powerful open-source office suite that can be used to convert `.doc` files to `.docx` using Java, typically by invoking its command-line interface. Here's a deeper dive into how to make it work smoothly:

---

### üß∞ What You‚Äôll Need
- **LibreOffice installed** on your system
- Java code to invoke LibreOffice via command line
- Proper file paths and permissions

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. **Install LibreOffice**
Make sure LibreOffice is installed and accessible from your system‚Äôs PATH. You can verify by running:
```bash
soffice --version
```

#### 2. **Use Headless Mode for Conversion**
LibreOffice supports a headless mode (no GUI) that‚Äôs perfect for automated tasks.

#### 3. **Java Code to Trigger Conversion**
Here‚Äôs a sample Java snippet that uses `ProcessBuilder` to call LibreOffice:

```java
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class DocConverter {
    public static void convertDocToDocx(String inputPath, String outputDir) throws IOException {
        ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder(
            "soffice",
            "--headless",
            "--convert-to", "docx",
            "--outdir", outputDir,
            inputPath
        );

        pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
        Process process = pb.start();

        // Optional: wait for process to complete
        try {
            process.waitFor();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        String inputFile = "/path/to/input.doc";
        String outputDirectory = "/path/to/output/";
        convertDocToDocx(inputFile, outputDirectory);
    }
}
```

---

### üìÅ Output
- The converted `.docx` file will appear in the specified `outputDirectory`.
- LibreOffice automatically names it based on the original file.

---

### üß† Tips & Gotchas
- **File Permissions**: Ensure your Java process has read/write access to the paths.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux ‚Äî just adjust the `soffice` path if needed.
- **Batch Conversion**: You can loop through multiple `.doc` files and convert them in bulk.
