Java doesn't have a built-in API for directly monitoring network usage. However, you can achieve this by measuring the data sent and received through your network interfaces using external libraries or native tools. Here's an example approach:

1. **Using `java.net.NetworkInterface`:** You can use the `NetworkInterface` class to gather basic information about network interfaces, but it doesn't directly provide usage statistics like bandwidth or percentage utilization.

2. **Invoke System Commands:** You can invoke system commands using Java's `Runtime` or `ProcessBuilder` to capture network statistics from tools like `netstat` (Windows) or `ifstat`/`sar` (Linux). Then, parse the output to calculate usage as a percentage.

Here's an example that demonstrates calling a system command:
```


3. **Third-Party Libraries:** For more robust monitoring, libraries like [OSHI (Operating System & Hardware Information)](https://oshi.github.io/oshi/) can be used. OSHI is a Java library that provides comprehensive hardware and OS statistics, including network usage.

Here's an example using OSHI:

```
import oshi.SystemInfo;
import oshi.hardware.NetworkIF;

import java.util.List;

public class OshiNetworkUsage {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        SystemInfo si = new SystemInfo();
        List<NetworkIF> networkIFs = si.getHardware().getNetworkIFs();

        for (NetworkIF net : networkIFs) {
            net.updateAttributes(); // Update stats
            long bytesSent = net.getBytesSent();
            long bytesReceived = net.getBytesRecv();

            System.out.println("Network Interface: " + net.getName());
            System.out.println("Bytes Sent: " + bytesSent);
            System.out.println("Bytes Received: " + bytesReceived);
        }
    }
}
```

### To calculate usage percentage:
- Measure bytes sent/received at two time intervals.
- Calculate the difference in bytes over time.
- Compare with your network bandwidth to compute the percentage usage.
