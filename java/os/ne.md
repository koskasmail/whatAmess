Java doesn't have a built-in API for directly monitoring network usage. However, you can achieve this by measuring the data sent and received through your network interfaces using external libraries or native tools. Here's an example approach:

1. **Using `java.net.NetworkInterface`:** You can use the `NetworkInterface` class to gather basic information about network interfaces, but it doesn't directly provide usage statistics like bandwidth or percentage utilization.

2. **Invoke System Commands:** You can invoke system commands using Java's `Runtime` or `ProcessBuilder` to capture network statistics from tools like `netstat` (Windows) or `ifstat`/`sar` (Linux). Then, parse the output to calculate usage as a percentage.

Here's an example that demonstrates calling a system command:
