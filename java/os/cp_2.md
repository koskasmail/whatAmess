To perform a file copy operation in Java with administrator privileges (e.g., when copying to a restricted directory like `C:\jars`), Java itself doesn't provide direct methods to elevate the program's permissions to "admin" level. However, you can achieve this in a few ways:

1. **Running the Java program with Administrator privileges**:
   If the program needs to access or write to restricted directories (like `C:\`), you need to run the entire program as an Administrator. Here’s how you can ensure that your Java program runs with admin privileges:
   
   ### On Windows:
   - Right-click on the `cmd.exe` or the Java executable (`java.exe`) and select "Run as administrator".
   - You can also configure your IDE (like Eclipse or IntelliJ) to run the program as admin.

2. **Using a batch file to request admin elevation**:
   You can create a batch file that requests administrator privileges, then runs your Java program. Here's an example:

   **Step 1: Create the Java code**:

   ```java
   import java.io.IOException;
   import java.nio.file.*;

   public class FileCopyExample {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Path source = Paths.get("\\\\ntsrv1\\share\\this.jar");
           Path target = Paths.get("C:\\jars\\this.jar");

           try {
               // Copy the file
               Files.copy(source, target, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
               System.out.println("File copied successfully!");
           } catch (IOException e) {
               System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
               e.printStackTrace();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   **Step 2: Create a batch file to run the program with admin rights**:

   Save the following batch script as `runAsAdmin.bat`:

   ```batch
   @echo off
   :: Check for administrator rights
   net session >nul 2>&1
   if %errorLevel% == 0 (
       echo Running with administrator privileges.
       java -jar "yourProgram.jar"
   ) else (
       echo Requesting administrator privileges...
       powershell -Command "Start-Process cmd -ArgumentList '/c runAsAdmin.bat' -Verb RunAs"
   )
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - This batch script checks if it is running with admin rights using `net session`.
   - If it doesn't have admin privileges, it restarts the batch file using PowerShell with the `RunAs` verb to request elevation.

3. **Programmatically requesting admin privileges**:
   You can launch your Java program from a batch file that automatically requests administrator privileges using the `RunAs` command or PowerShell like in the above example. Java itself doesn’t handle privilege escalation internally; it must be done at the system level.

Once you've elevated privileges, your Java program will be able to copy the file from the network share to `C:\jars` successfully.
