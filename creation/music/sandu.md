Short example of part of a personally completed song using these methods:
[Intro: Jazzy piano chords with a lo-fi crackle, distant sleigh bells, and a laid-back drum loop.]
[Spoken Word]
"Yo, it’s the most wonderful time… and the most stressful.
From the gift wrap to the setbacks, let’s talk about it.
Detroit, let’s vibe."
[Chorus: Smooth, soulful hook with layered harmonies and a saxophone riff between lines.]
It’s the holly and the hard times, joy and the grind,
Snow on the streets, but the heat’s in the rhymes.
Eggnog and missteps, family and debt,
Lightin’ up the tree, tryin’ hard to forget
