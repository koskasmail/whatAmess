#### About the Author

```
Samuel Youd (born February 12, 1922) is a British
science fiction author. Youd was born in Lancashire.
He did his war service in the Royal Signal Corps 1941-
1946. A scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation
made it possible for him to pursue his writing career
beginning with The Winter Swan. His novels were
popular during the 1950s and 1960s, most notably The
Death Of Grass, although there was a revival in the
1980s after British television dramatised The Tripods. In
recent years his novels appear to have fallen out of favour and now few remain
in print, although they are still valued by collectors and fans of the genre.
Many of his science fiction novels follow the ruined earth pattern also
followed by authors John Wyndham or H. G. Wells. In these novels everyday
characters are placed into a setting in which they experience a major disaster
which has severe implications for society and the world. Thus, he explores how
characters and society cope with such changes.
In 1966 he started writing science-fiction for adolescents. The Tripods trilogy,
the Prince in Waiting trilogy (also known as the Sword of the Spirits trilogy) and
the Lotus Caves are still widely read today.

#### Capping Day
```
part from the one in the church tower, there were five clocks in the
village that kept reasonable time, and my father owned one of
them. It stood on the mantelpiece in the parlor, and every night
before he went to bed he took the key from a vase and wound it up. Once a year
the clockman came from Winchester, on an old jogging pack horse, to clean and
oil it and put it right. Afterward he would drink camomile tea with my mother
and tell her the news of the city and what he had heard in the villages through
which he had passed. My father, if he was not busy milling, would stalk out at
this time with some contemptuous remark about gossip; but later, in the
evening, I would hear my mother passing the stories on to him. He did not show
much enthusiasm, but he listened to them.
My father's great treasure, though, was not the clock, but the Watch. This, a
miniature clock with a dial less than an inch across and a circlet permitting it to
be worn on the wrist, was kept in a locked drawer of his desk and only brought
out to be worn on ceremonial occasions, such as Harvest Festival or a Capping.
The clockman was allowed to see to it only every third year, and at such times
my father stood by, watching him as he worked. There was no other Watch in
the village, nor in any of the villages round about. The clockman said there were
a number in Winchester, but none as fine as this. I wondered if he said it to
please my father, who certainly showed pleasure in the hearing, but I believe it
truly was of very good workmanship. The body of the Watch was of a steel much
superior to anything they could make at the forge in Alton, and the works inside
were a wonder of intricacy and skill. On the front were printed "Anti-magnetique"
and "Incabloc," which we supposed to have been the name of the craftsman
who made it in olden times.

The clockman had visited us the week before, and I had been permitted to
look on for a time while he cleaned and oiled the Watch. The sight fascinated
me, and after he had gone I found my thoughts running continually on this
treasure, now locked away again in its drawer. I was, of course, forbidden to
touch my father's desk, and the notion of opening a locked drawer in it should
have been unthinkable. Nonetheless, the idea persisted. And after a day or two I
admitted to myself that it was only the fear of being caught that prevented me.
On Saturday morning I found myself alone in the house. My father was in the
mill room, grinding, and the servants - even Molly who normally did not leave the
house during the day - had been brought in to help. My mother was out visiting
old Mrs. Ash, who was sick, and would be gone an hour at least. I had finished
my homework and there was nothing to stop my going out into the bright May
morning and finding Jack. But what completely filled my mind was the thought
that I had this opportunity to look at the Watch with small chance of detection.
The key, I had observed, was kept with the other keys in a small box beside
my father's bed. There were four, and the third one opened the drawer. I took
out the Watch, and gazed at it. It was not going, but I knew one wound it and
set the hands by means of the small knob at one side. If I were to wind it only a
couple of turns, it would run down quite soon - just in case my father decided to
look at it later in the day. I did this, and listened to its quiet rhythmic ticking.
Then I set the hands by the clock. After that it only remained for me to slip it on
my wrist. Even notched to the first hole, the leather strap was loose; but I was
wearing the Watch.
Having achieved what I had thought was an ultimate ambition, I found, as I
think is often the case, that there remained something more. To wear it was a
triumph, but to be seen wearing it...I had told my cousin, Jack Leeper, that I
would meet him that morning in the old ruins at the end of the village. Jack, who
was nearly a year older than myself and due to be presented at the next
Capping, was the person, next to my parents, whom I most admired. To take the
Watch out of the house was to add enormity to disobedience, but having already
