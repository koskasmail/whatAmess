* Here's a classic, simple, and quick recipe (less than 10 minutes of work):

### 📋 Ingredients (for a small jar)

* **Basil:** 2 cups of fresh basil leaves, packed (without the stems).
* **Olive oil:** 1/2 cup of good-quality olive oil.
* **Pine nuts:** 1/3 cup (can be replaced with walnuts or cashews for a cheaper version).
* **Garlic:** 2-3 cloves of garlic, peeled.
* **Cheese:** 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (for a vegan/vegan version - just omit the cheese or add a tablespoon of brewer's yeast).
* **Seasoning:** A pinch of salt and ground black pepper.
* **Optional:** A light squeeze of lemon juice (helps maintain the bright green color).

### 🥣 Preparation method

1. **Roasting (optional but recommended):** Toast the pine nuts in a dry frying pan (without oil) for 2-3 minutes over low heat until lightly golden. This brings out a deep nutty flavor.
2. **Initial grinding:** Place the basil, pine nuts, and garlic in a food processor (or blender). Pulse briefly until everything is coarsely chopped.
3. **Adding the oil:** While the appliance is running at low speed, drizzle in the olive oil in a thin stream until you get a uniform texture (but not too smooth – good pesto is a little grainy).
4. **Finishing and seasoning:** Add the Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Give it one more quick stir just to combine everything. Taste and adjust seasoning.

### 💡 Pro Tips

* **Preventing browning:** To prevent the pesto from turning brown when exposed to air, always coat the top with a thin layer of olive oil before sealing the jar.
* **Storage:** Pesto will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also freeze it in an ice cube tray, then take out a cube whenever you want to enrich a sauce or soup.
* **Upgrade:** If you like a "cheesier" pesto, you can replace some of the basil with rocket leaves (arugula).
