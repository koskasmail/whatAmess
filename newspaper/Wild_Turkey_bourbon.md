Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey is crafted with a deep commitment to tradition and quality. Here's a breakdown of how it's made:

### 🥃 Key Ingredients
- **Water**: Sourced from the Kentucky River, naturally filtered through limestone to remove iron and impurities.
- **Grains**: A mix of corn, rye, and malted barley—all non-GMO and quality-tested multiple times.
- **Yeast**: Wild Turkey uses a proprietary yeast strain that’s been part of its flavor profile for over 60 years.

### 🔥 Distillation & Aging
- **Charred Barrels**: The bourbon is aged in American White Oak barrels with a No. 4 “alligator” char—the deepest level—to enhance flavor and color.
- **Aging Time**: Although legally bourbon only needs to age for two years, Wild Turkey ages its whiskey for at least five years, often longer.
- **Rick Houses**: Barrels are stored in tin-clad wooden rick houses dating back to the 1890s, allowing maximum interaction between wood and whiskey.

### 🛠️ Production Process
1. **Handling & Milling**: Master Distillers select and mill the grains.
2. **Mashing & Malting**: Grains are cooked with limestone-filtered water to create a mash.
3. **Fermentation**: The mash is fermented using the proprietary yeast.
4. **Distillation**: The fermented mash is distilled to extract alcohol.
5. **Barreling**: The distilled spirit is aged in charred oak barrels.
6. **Bottling**: After aging, the bourbon is filtered and bottled.
