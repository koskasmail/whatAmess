### 📖 Article Body

#### 🔥 The Mash-Up That Matters
Wild Turkey starts with a trio of grains—corn, rye, and malted barley—each chosen for punch and purity. The water? Straight from the Kentucky River, filtered through limestone like nature’s Brita.

> **Pull Quote:**  
> “It’s not just bourbon. It’s a battle cry in a bottle.”

---

#### 🧪 Yeast & Fire
The same yeast strain has been used for over 60 years. It’s the secret sauce behind Wild Turkey’s signature kick.

> **Sidebar: Did You Know?**  
> - Bourbon must be made in the U.S. to earn the name  
> - Wild Turkey uses a deeper barrel char than most brands  
> - The yeast strain is older than most rock legends

---

#### 🛢️ Barrel-Aged Attitude
Aged in American white oak barrels with a No. 4 “alligator” char, this bourbon doesn’t just sit—it evolves.

> **Pull Quote:**  
> “Charred like Hendrix’s guitar. Smooth like Clapton’s solo.”

---

#### 🏚️ Rickhouse Realness
Stored in tin-clad wooden rickhouses from the 1890s, the barrels breathe with the seasons, soaking up flavor like a vinyl record absorbs soul.

---

#### 🧠 Master Distillers with Swagger
Jimmy and Eddie Russell are the Mick and Keith of bourbon. They don’t follow trends—they set them.

> **Pull Quote:**  
> “We don’t chase flavor. We wrestle it.”

---

#### 🥃 The Final Pour
Filtered, bottled, and ready to raise hell—or at least raise eyebrows. Whether neat or mixed, Wild Turkey is a toast to rebellion.
