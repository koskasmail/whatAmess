### 🎸 Banner Concept: *The Kessler Style* Magazine

**📰 Top Section: Magazine Logo**
- **Text**: “The Kessler Style”
- **Font**: Distressed serif or bold slab with electric edges—think *Rolling Stone* meets *Creem*.
- **Style**: Newspaper masthead meets rock poster. Add lightning bolts, vinyl grooves, or a torn-paper texture.
- **Color Scheme**: Black, deep crimson, metallic silver, with a smoky gradient.

**🔥 Middle Section: Article Title**
- **Text**: “Wild Turkey Bourbon: The Rebel Spirit of Kentucky”
- **Font**: Gritty, dynamic script or stencil-style—evokes rebellion and southern swagger.
- **Background**: Flames, cracked leather, or a faded concert ticket motif.

**🎸 Bottom Section: Writer Credit**
- **Text**: “By [Your Name]”
- **Icon**: A guitar pick with a skull wearing sunglasses, or a vintage mic with wings.
- **Placement**: Bottom-right corner, like a signature on a tour poster.
