## 📘 Tips for Building and Using the Repo

- **README.md**: Use this file to explain the purpose of the repo, how to navigate it, and any learning goals.
- **Modular folders**: Break topics into folders like `basics`, `functions`, `DOM`, etc., to keep things tidy.
- **Mini-projects**: Include small projects like a calculator or to-do app to apply what you've learned.
- **Resources folder**: Store helpful links, notes, or cheat sheets for quick reference.
- **Version control**: Commit regularly with meaningful messages like `Added examples for array methods`.
